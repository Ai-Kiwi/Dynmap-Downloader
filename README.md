# Dynmap-Downloader
Just a simple program i made to download dynamap then make it into a image.

# How to use
I wouldn't recommend using this as the current system for how chunk pos work make no sence but feel free to. 
Apart from the ip and the Chunk postions most of the default values will be fine.
When downloading the red text is normal it means it failed to get a chunk data, It will try again by default 2 more times before giving up.

# Requirements
 - pillow
 - colorama
